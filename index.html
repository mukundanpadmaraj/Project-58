            <p>My favourite hobby is cycling. The journey of cycling becoming my favourite hobby started from 2nd grade when my father gave me a 4 wheeled cycle. I started to ride it a lot. Then we decided to keep it in my father's house as there's more space to ride it. I started to ride there and rode a lot aswell. My father then removed the balance wheels. I started to do the excact opposite sfter that as I couldn't ride with just 2 wheels back then.<br/><br/>But my father told me to be brave and to ride the cycle. After that I taught myself how to ride my cycle. Years flew by my cycle's seat got higher and higher until I needed a new cycle. So I borrowed my cousin sister's cycle. Now I am still requesting my father to buy me a new cycle. Which will go on until my father allows, I guess.
